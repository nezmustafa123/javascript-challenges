//first class and higher order functions

//functions are first-class citizens/values

//another type of object objects are values functions are values too


//store them in variables and object properties
//pass functions as arguments into other functions
//can return function from another function
//functions are objects so there are functions/methods on functions

//function that recieves another function as an agument returns a new function or both is higer order function
//first class function feature that programming language has or doesn't 
//there are higher order functions in practice
