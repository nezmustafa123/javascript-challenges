//1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate
//the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do
//not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla:
//recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of
//food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
//2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too
//little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in
//the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) ðŸ¤“
//3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
//('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
//('ownersEatTooLittle').
//4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and
//Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat
//too little!"
//5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food
//that is recommended (just true or false)
//6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food
//(just true or false)
//7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try
//to reuse the condition used in 6.)
//8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food
//portion in an ascending
