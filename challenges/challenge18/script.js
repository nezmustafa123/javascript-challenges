//too little!"
//5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food
//that is recommended (just true or false)
//6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food
//(just true or false)
//7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try
//to reuse the condition used in 6.)
//8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food
//portion in an ascending
